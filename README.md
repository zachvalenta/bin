# TODO

📍 move anything that could be a one-liner out of here and into an alias

## workflow

- [ ] `dance`, `viz` to Bash
- [ ] sym links

## ding

- [ ]  move to `printf`
- [ ]  new line after each
- [ ]  `-h` (like argparse)
- [ ]  fix input glitch (cannot backspace, use normal Bash shortcuts)
- [ ]  move to own repo, [laziestgit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) --> "Note: This is a work in-progress. When you break it, let me know!"
- [ ]  explain use cae - run after you check out `git diff`, have a commit msg in mind, and don't want to spend the extra 15 seconds; re often you commit, the more time you save (maybe a counter at the end listing time saved on this repo using ding)
- [ ]  asciicinema, neofetch

## fne

- [ ] regex - lowercase
- [ ] regex - kebab case
- [ ] file extension - PDF (for language-learning audio files)

## za

- [ ] `pyp`: add - changelog, license
- [ ] `kcm`: fix (also, why the sudden flakiness?)
- [ ] `qiu`: move into own repo, cf. `4-testing.md`
- [ ] dictionary pronunciation https://dictionaryapi.com/
- [ ] music lib: mirror as text files https://facebook.github.io/watchman/ https://github.com/target/strelka
- [ ] zsh + 艘 'FreeCodeCamp Medium style terminal'
- [ ] `py-wiki` = Py version of [wikit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wikit)
- [ ] `nba-go` for Python https://github.com/swar/nba_api
- [ ] `pyp`: [other projects](https://github.com/reorx/project_sketch), add (coverage, Makefile, changelog, `setup.py`, license, `.editorconfig`), CLI (`--min`, `--max`)
