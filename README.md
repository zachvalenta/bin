# util scripts

## why?

grab bag of utilities I'm hacking on in order to: 

* improve at sysadmin/devops tasks
* fix (mostly self-inflicted) problems on my personal machine

## manifest of scripts

- `fne.py` (file name editor): CLI for file edits using argparse
- `pmp.py` (Python make Python): boilerplate for Python project
