# what is this?

Just a few utilities I have on `$PATH` that make my day easier.

Most are only relevant to me but here are few you might use, too:

__Git-related__

* `di`: one-step add and commit for single file 
* `ding`: same as `di` but for multiples files 
* `gr`: one-step hard reset 

__everything else__

* `fne`: file name editor
* `m2h`: Markdown-to-HTML converter using [water.css](https://github.com/kognise/water.css)
* `qing`: safe alternative to `rm`
* `qiu`: wraps `httpie` for local dev
