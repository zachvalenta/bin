# what is this?

My `bin` directory.

__general__

* `qing`: safe alternative to `rm`
* `m2h`: Markdown-to-HTML converter using [water.css](https://github.com/kognise/water.css)
* `kcm`: kill cmus; [cmus is awesome](https://github.com/cmus/cmus) but sometimes gets stuck and this hunts down the process by name and kills it
* `mtrim`: use pydub to clip start/end of audio files
* `vimv`: file name editor ([project link](https://github.com/ivanmaeder/vimv))

__notes directory__

* `jb`: all commits in sprint + index
* `jbs`: diff sprint/main
* `jbc`: diff file
