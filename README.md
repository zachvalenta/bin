# what is this?

Just a few utilities I have on `$PATH` that make my day easier.

Most are only relevant to me but here are few you might use, too:

__Git-related__

* `di`: one-step add and commit for single file 
* `ding`: same as `di` but for multiples files 
* `gr`: one-step hard reset 

__everything else__

* `fne`: file name editor (specifically for bulk updates on audio files downloaded using `youtube-dl`)
* `mtrim`: use pydub to clip start/end of audio files
* `vimv`: file name editor (for general purpose editing; [project link](https://github.com/ivanmaeder/vimv))
* `kcm`: 'kill cmus'; [cmus is awesome](https://github.com/cmus/cmus) but sometimes gets stuck; this hunts down the process by name and kills it
* `kaiff`: open first file in directory; I use it pop open Youtube talks I've downloaded to listen to as podcasts from the directory where I dump those files https://github.com/zachvalenta/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_profile#L50
* `m2h`: Markdown-to-HTML converter using [water.css](https://github.com/kognise/water.css)
* `qing`: safe alternative to `rm`
* `qiu`: wraps `httpie` for local dev
